To create a new web app project inside the Web folder, use: dotnet new webApp -o myWebApp --no-https
The webApp parameter selects what template to use when creating your app
The -o parameter creates a directory named myWebApp which holds your entire web app project
The --no-https flag specifies not to enable HTTPS

In the myWebApp folder, Program.cs contains the main source code
Startup.cs contains all the settings and configurations
The Pages folder contains some example web pages for the application
myWebApp.csproj defines the libraries which are referenced

Move into the myWebApp folder: cd myWebApp
Start the program using: dotnet run
Go to localhost:5000 and you'll see the web app
The html page you are seeing is mainly from Pages/Index.cshtml and Pages/Shared/_Layout.cshtml
If you click on Privacy, you'll be shown the Pages/Privacy.cshtml and Pages/Shared/_Layout.cshtml
