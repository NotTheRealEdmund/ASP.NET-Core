Create a portfolio web app inside the Portfolio folder, use: dotnet new webApp -o myPortfolio --no-https
Move into the myWebApp folder: cd myPortfolio
Start the program using: dotnet run
Go to localhost:5000 and you'll see the web app.

The Pages folder contains Razor pages and supporting files.
Each Razor page is a pair of files: 
One .cshtml file that contains HTML markup with C# code using Razor syntax.
One .cshtml.cs file that contains C# code that handles page events.
Supporting files have names that begin with an underscore. 
For example, the _Layout.cshtml file configures UI elements common to all pages. 
This file sets up the navigation menu at the top of the page and the copyright notice at the bottom of the page. 

wwwroot folder
Contains static files, such as HTML files, JavaScript files, and CSS files. 

appSettings.json
Contains configuration data, such as connection strings.

Program.cs
Contains the entry point for the program.

Startup.cs
Contains code that configures app behavior.

Make most changes in the _Layout.cshtml file and the Index.cshtml file. 
If you want to use other routes, for example /About, 
just copy and paste the Privacy.cshtml and Privacy.cshtml.cs files, 
rename them to About.cshtml and About.cshtml.cs files, 
and then change the html inside the About.cshtml file, 
remember to also change the asp-page="/Privacy" inside the _Layout.cshtml file to asp-page="/About".
Also, in the About.cshtml and About.cshtml.cs files, change the Models to AboutModel.
